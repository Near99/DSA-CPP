# Practical Data structures and Algorithms in C++

## Array

### :heavy_check_mark: Dynamic Array Implementation.

- [x] Well, I don't think I will implement another Vector in CPP, but let's see ;).

### Array algorithm practice questions:

- [x] Is Unique.
- [ ] Check Permutation.
- [ ] URLify.
- [ ] Palindrome Permutation.
- [ ] One Away.
- [ ] String Compression.
- [ ] Rotate Matrix.
- [ ] Zero Matrix.
- [ ] String Rotation.

### Blind 75:

- [x] Two Number Sum.
- [ ] Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock.
- [ ] Contains Duplicate.
- [ ] Product of Array Except Self.

## Tree

### :heavy_check_mark: Binary Search Tree Implementation.

- [x] `BinarySearchTree::insert()`            - insert a new node in BST.
- [x] `BinarySearchTree::remove()`            - remove a node from BST.
- [x] `BinarySearchTree::traverse()`          - traverse BST in preorder.
- [x] `BinarySearchTree::print()`             - print all nodes and its parents info.
- [x] `BinarySearchTree::count()`             - count of nodes.
- [x] `BinarySearchTree::getMax()`            - max number in BST.
- [x] `BinarySearchTree::getMin()`            - min number in BST.
- [x] `BinarySearchTree::getHeight()`         - height of the BST.
- [x] `BinarySearchTree::successor()`         - find inorder successor.
- [x] `BinarySearchTree::isValid()`           - if BST is valid.
- [x] `BinarySearchTree::contain()`           - if contain the target element.
- [x] `BinarySearchTree::isEmpty()`           - if tree is empty.

### BST algorithm practice questions:

- [x] Find Closet Value In BST.
- [x] Valid BST.
- [x] Delete Node In BST.
- [x] Inorder Successor In BST.

### Blind 75:

- [x] Maximum Depth of Binary Tree.
- [x] Same Tree.
- [x] Invert Binary Tree.
- [ ] Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum.
- [ ] Binary Tree Level Order Traversal.
