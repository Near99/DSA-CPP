# Practical Data structures and Algorithms in C++

## Array

### :heavy_check_mark: Dynamic Array Implementation.

- [x] Well, I don't think I will implement another Vector in CPP, but let's see ;).

### Array algorithm practice questions:

- [x] Is Unique.
- [x] Two Number Sum.

## Tree

### :heavy_check_mark: Binary Search Tree Implementation.

- [x] `BinarySearchTree::insert()`            - insert a new node in BST.
- [x] `BinarySearchTree::remove()`            - remove a node from BST.
- [x] `BinarySearchTree::traverse()`          - traverse BST (inorder).
- [x] `BinarySearchTree::print()`             - print all nodes and its parents info.
- [x] `BinarySearchTree::count()`             - count of nodes.
- [x] `BinarySearchTree::getMax()`            - max number in BST.
- [x] `BinarySearchTree::getMin()`            - min number in BST.
- [x] `BinarySearchTree::getHeight()`         - height of BST.
- [x] `BinarySearchTree::isValid()`           - if BST is valid.
- [x] `BinarySearchTree::contain()`           - if contain the target element.
- [x] `BinarySearchTree::isEmpty()`           - if tree is empty.

### BST algorithm practice questions:

- [x] Find Closet Value In BST.
- [x] Valid BST.
